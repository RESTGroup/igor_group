## 🧬 Research Focus

Prof. Zhang's research is centered on developing high-accuracy density functional theory methods and the software needed to apply them to challenging chemical problems.

*   **Advancing and Extending Doubly Hybrid Functionals (xDH & R-xDH)**
    *   He is a principal founder of the **XYG3-type doubly hybrid functionals**, which achieve chemical accuracy for main-group chemistry without augmented empirical dispersion corrections. The xDH framework is widely recognized and adopted in the field.
    *   He further extended this paradigm to **strongly correlated systems**, developing the **ZRPS functional** for two-body correlations and the **renormalized R-xDH framework** (including the machine-learning-enhanced R-xDH7-SCC15 method) for many-body correlations, enabling accurate studies of bond dissociation and transition-metal chemistry.

*   **Bridging DFT with Multireference Theory via Cross-Entropy Correction**
    *   To tackle strong correlation beyond the single-reference framework, Prof. Zhang proposed a **generalized hybrid multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (HMC-PDFT)** by introducing a cross-entropy term, yielding a comprehensive improvement over existing MC-PDFT methods. The resulting **tB4LYP functional** demonstrates superior accuracy to CASPT2 while retaining CASSCF-like computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for photochemistry and catalysis.

*   **Developing High-Performance Software: From Algorithm to Platform**
    *   In established software ecosystems (e.g., FHI-aims), he pioneered the implementation of scalable algorithms and periodic doubly hybrid functionals, enabling large-scale parallel computation.
    *   Leveraging deep software expertise, he independently led the development of the **Rust-based REST platform**, designed to efficiently support advanced functionals like xDH and R-xDH, making high-accuracy electronic structure methods more accessible and practical.
